            <h1>A Selection of different games </h1>
            
            <p>DISCLAIMER:- The layout and scoring of these games can differ from pub to pub. The following is just based on my experiences playing these games.</p>
            <br>
             <h3>Halvos</h3>
            <div>
            <img class="relegion" src="Darts_images/darts-relegion.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
            <p>Halvos is a great game for all, as no matter what level player you are at, come the end of the game most if not all will be in with a shot for victory.</p>
            
             <p>Halvos can be played with as many players who want to join. U first start by selecting the numbers you want to hit throughout the game. Most games usually begin with 20 (then 19,18,17 .... ) Usually a D wil b included (which means any double on the board, also any (T) which indicates any treble. You usually finish with a (B) as tyhe last number to hit </p>
    
            <p>The game begins with each player has 3 darts at the first number and they attermpt to score as much as possible. Doubles and trebles all count in the score. After that you then move through the rest of the numbers. The most important part of the game is that failure to hit a certain number, then that player will half their score. So players can get off to high scoring starts but can then fail to hit a double or treble, then their score will be halved.</p>
    
            <p>U can make the game more dificult by reducing the number of whoole numbers and including targets such as BWB (a black part of the the board then a white bit, followed by a black part (all darts must be in play to count). Also 3DC (3 different colours which would involve hitting a red, white,green, or black part of the board. Or even adding some random specefic doubles or trebles (eg D12 or T18)</p>
        
            <p>Finally you can add some of the wall targets such as Split 11 or even the R10. Often a scoring value of 100 points is assigned to these targets for any player who hits it</p>
        </div>
            <br>
            <h3>How bout a round of GOLF</h3>
            <div>
             <img class="beerimg" src="Darts_images/Beer-and-darts.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
            <p>This is also a great form of practice. Just like golf, you play the numbers 1-18. Starting on no.1, the aim is to try hit the treble of each number which count as an albatros or (-3) If you hit the big part of the single it counts as a par (E), the smaller part of the single would count as a birdie (-1), and a double would then count as an eagle (-2). Failure to hit the number would inciur a 2 shot penalty (+2)   </p>
        
            <p>You then score the game as the way its marked in golf, where the lowest score wins</p>
        </div>
            <br>
            <h3>Cricket</h3>
            <div>
             <img class="team" src="Darts_images/darts-problem.jpg">
            <p>Cricket usually involves the numbers 15-20 and the bullseye. The aim of the game is to hit each number 3 times. For example a treble 20 would box off 20s and can then move onto a different number. Each player can start on any number they want, and can through their darts at differnt numbers. </p>

            <p>Additionally when  a player has boxed of number (example 20s), they can the continue to hit it and score additional points.</p>
        
            <p>The winner of the game would be the player who has boxed off each of the numbers.</p>
